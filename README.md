# KeepTalkingProgrammingChallenge
Quite simply, this is a set of programming challenges based off the VR game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes".  The goal is to write something akin to the backend code that runs each module.

The challenges are for programmers who are reasonable new to python, but can be an optimization challenge for experienced programmers.

Each folder will contain any necessary data for that challenge, minus the manuel, avaliable [here](http://www.bombmanual.com/manual/1/pdf/Bomb-Defusal-Manual_1.pdf).

In the folders you will find 3 python files: the solution file, the tester file, and the file for you to code in.

Just open the file with the same name as the folder and you will find additional information and a shell to begin coding in.

Good Luck!
